I am a third-year Master’s student at CS Department, Fudan University advised by Prof. Weifeng Ge. Previously, I received my Bachelor’s Degree in the CS Department, Southeast University, where I worked with Prof. Ding Ding. My research primarily focuses on Multimodal Large Langauge Models and their broad applications (Visual Question Answering, Video Understanding, Embodied-AI, Image/Video Generation, etc.). I’m currently working with Prof. Lifu Huang on building unified models for video understanding and generation. 
 structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
